## Suggestions on how to use this material

1. First just watch the lesson. Take in the information, see how it all fits together.
2. Then go through more slowly, pausing the video and try things out.
3. Do things the way Jeremy does, then do it your own way.

## The organisation: *Fast.Ai*

Making deep learning accessible

- Software: Make these tools available to use quickly, reliably, and with minimal code.
- Education: so that as many people as possible can use these tools.
- Research: Ways to make state of the art deep learning techniques more accessible.
- Community: so we can help each other

## The course: *Practical deep learning for coders*

- 7 lessons (each 2 hours long)
- 8 to 10 hours homework per lesson
- After 7 lessons, create a world class model to:
  - Classify pet photos
  - Identify movie review sentiment (text)
